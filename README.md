## Description
Are you often distracted by external interruptions like incoming e-mails, notifications of your phone, ...? But do you really want to be more focused will working on something? Than you certainly need to give the pomodoro technique a shot!

**How does it work?**<br>
Because of the work cycle isn't that much (traditionally 25 minutes) you will work harder! Otherwise you will maybe start thinking "I have time enough, I can take it easy".

Now, after the (hopefully productive) work cycle your brain needs to rest a little bit, 3-5 minutes is enough to recharge the battery inside your head. Enough time to check your notifications, go to the bathroom, ...

But than the difficult part, starting a new cycle... Than just think back to the initial reason why your done this. Yeah, indeed to become more productive! So let's beat the next cycle! It will become easier after a while.

After 4 such cycles you formed a set, congratulations! Now you certainly deserve to take a longer rest (15-30 minutes). If you want to you can start a new set after this big relax cycle.

**Tips**<br>
* Turn your phone in the 'do not disturb' mode during the work cycle.
* Close all social media related tabs
* Try to complete full sets
